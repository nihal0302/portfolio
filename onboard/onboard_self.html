                  <p>As a travel enthusiast, I've been to a lot of places and taken a ton of flights. But no matter how many times I fly, I always feel a little stressed on travel day, even if I'm super prepared. This is what inspired me to create a product that can help to reduce the stress experienced by the travelers on the day of their flight.</p>

                    <li><p>How far is airport in your city from the place where you live and how much time does it take you to reach the airport? How much does it cost to take the private taxi? Do you feel relaxed after boarding the taxi on time from your home? If not, then why?</p></li>
